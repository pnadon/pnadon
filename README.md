# Hello ðŸ‘‹

on June 2020 I graduated with a BSc. from the University of Alberta, with majors in Mathematics and Physics and Computing Science.

## About me
I only started taking Computing Science courses in my 3rd year, but shortly after the Winter semester of that year I attended a Hackathon with friends which was hosted by a local city. 

Our submission to that Hackathon eventually led to the city contracting us to build [this tool](https://www.etatool.com/), and that amazing experience was what motivated me to add Computing Science to my existing Mathematics and Physics majors, and pursue the career of a Software Engineer.

Since then, I have also been contracted by the capital of my province to build a similar tool, worked 2 summers as an undergraduate researcher building a fuel cell model in Julia, designed and deployed a website for a local non-profit which lets them more easily view and manage shifts, [and more](https://acad.nadon.io/)!

As of August 2020, I am actively looking for a backend / lower-level software position, if you are interested feel free to contact me!
