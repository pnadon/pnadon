# Hello ðŸ‘‹

on June 2020 I graduated with a BSc. from the University of Alberta, with majors in Mathematics and Physics and Computing Science.

## About me
I only started taking Computing Science courses in my 3rd year, but shortly after the Winter semester of that year I attended a Hackathon with friends which was hosted by a local city. 

Our submission to that Hackathon eventually led to the city contracting us to build [this tool](https://www.etatool.com/), and that amazing experience was what motivated me to add Computing Science to my existing Mathematics and Physics majors, and pursue the career of a Software Engineer.

Since then, I have also been contracted by the capital of my province to build [a similar tool](https://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/traffic_safety/residential-speed-limits-eta-tool.aspx), worked 2 summers as an undergraduate researcher building a fuel cell model in Julia, designed and deployed a website for a local non-profit which lets them more easily view and manage shifts, [and more](https://acad.nadon.io/)!

## Current Projects
Most of my side projects at the moment involve writing small CLI tools (Tetris, GBA emulator) or web services (such as a Discord bot), usually in Rust.
My professional work has also led me to become interested in infrastructure-related tools such as Docker and Terraform and thus I have started to incorporate these technologies into my projects.
